Maximum Cut
=======================

Given a graph, G, determine a maximum cut is a cut whose size is at least the size of any other cut. 
That is, it is a partition of the graph's vertices into two complementary sets S and T, such that the 
number of edges between the set S and the set T is as large as possible.
